*To get your clippings file from your kindle, and import them into the spreadsheet, follow these steps:*

  - Go to the website https://www.clippings.io/, make an account, click import, and follow the instructions for your method of choice to import your clippings. (I use the 'Kindle 'My Clippings.txt'' method)
  - Once your clippings are imported, go to 'Export' and choose 'Excel 2007' and download the file.
  - Open the downloaded 'clippings_export' file, copy the all data including all headings.
  - Open the Random Kindle Highlights Emailer Template document, click on the sheet 'Paste Clippings Here' and paste the data into cell 'A1' - this will replace the template content.
  - Press ctrl+f, press the 3 dots settings icon for more options, in 'Find' type 'Notes: ' (make sure the space space after the : is included), for 'Search', change 'All sheets' to 'Specific range', select column I (the notes column), click 'Replace All' and 'Done'. 
  
  **3) Setting up the automatic emailer.**

*To set up the automatic daily emails and test the emailer, follow these steps:*

  - Go to the 'Email Content' sheet, in the cell that contains 'youremailgoeshere@email' type your email address.
  - To test the 'Send Email' button, press it, if a box appears retuesting authorisation, click continue, choose an email address, click advanced, click 'Go to Random Kindle Highlights Emailer (unsafe)' - click Allow. To receive a test email press the 'Send Email' button and check your emails.
